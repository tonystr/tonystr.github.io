            <p>
                Hello, again! This week I've continued work on ATIRAG, and played a bit with node.js. (The title is a joke) In my previous post, I compiled a list of features I wanted to add. Amongst them were colored stars,
                which I tried and removed, as I did not find anything that looked better than pure white. I did however play with the stars, trying to make them more interesting. One of my ideas
                was to have some percentage of stars spawn in different clusters, and while it looked somewhat neat, I ended up scrapping two or three days of work. With the exception of some small changes,
                the stars are almost identical to last week, but at least they're more open for customization and perform better because of some reworked code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enemy AI has improved. I scrapped the idea of enemies having a DNA variable, as that's really just an excuse for random enemy states. There are now two enemy types, one that oscillates
                horizontally, and one that moves towards you horizontally. Both move vertically at a fixed speed, and if you don't kill them, they eventually move outside the level, where they turn and fly
                back to the top. If you hit them while they're flying back, you'll take damage as if you were hit by a missile. This gives the player more of an incentive to kill the enemies, as they not
                only return, but also threaten to deal triple damage. Future plans involve having the enemies become more powerful the more they've hit the bottom of the level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another point on my list was to have larger bullets, because they're currently very small and are not as alarming as they should be. I tried playing with giving them outlines, however outlines
                turned out to look horrible, and actually making them stick out even less, despite using contrasting colors to the background. I've scrapped the idea of outlines, but I'll likely come back to
                this later, with differently shaped bullets.
            </p>

                    </div>

            </div>
            <p>
                The two enemy types compliment eachother, in that the occilating ones make you move back and forth horizontally, mimicking their pattern, and the homing enemies make you stop top maximize
                damage. Alone, you know how to kill both of these enemies, and you know how to avoid their attacks, but together they create for all kinds of scenarios, forcing you to continuously adapt to
                new situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I've added some visual effects to make the game more engaging and responsive. The enemies now explode when the die (much better than just vanishing), though it could do with some more
                effects. I might use particles in the future. The angle of impulse from bullets now makes more sense, which is more satisfying. The player and enemies rotate when moving, which adds some
                visual feedback, and helps the player better predict movement of enemies, even if they're not in focus. The bullets are angled differently depending on the player/enemy's orientation, meaning
                you have more control over your bullets, however this can also be considered a negative effect, as a player might find themselves forced to move in order to avoid a bullet, which might
                send their bullets off-course in a direction they did not intend. I've also added some smaller features for fun, such as that the fire from a spaceship can destroy enemy bullets, or a
                small, hard to spot, effect with the stars, which ever so slightly makes the movement feel more 3d, by altering the speed of the stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I didn't progress as much as I'd hoped, but I learnt a valuable lesson that taught me overprogramming is a waste of time. I've updated the list to reflect the changes, and added
                some new points to it.
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                     <li class="scrapped">  Colored stars

            </ul>
            <p>
                Next, I'll likely focus on balancing, and adding a new enemy type.
