                Easter has concluded, but Motherlode has not been left untouched. Over the Easter break, I've spent a lot of time fixing and adding to Motherlode. I finished the Grid-based inventory from last week, and made some sprites for the different items
                aquireable in the game. A list on the right of your inventory now shows all your items, and how many you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the only items that work are Dynamites and Plastic explosives. Neither of the teleporters have been programmed yet. The Auto Repair Nanobots are currently
                useless, because I've not implemented a health (hull) system yet, and the same goes for the Reserve Fuel Tanks, as you don't have a fuel dependency yet.
            </p>
            <p> I'm planning to add the gas station and fuel system last (of the stores & stations), because when a fuel dependency is present, the game will immediately need balancing, and all the other aspects must be taken into account when balancing.
                I have instead made the Mining Deposit, and started working on the Emendation Station, as you can see in the gif below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ores are now mineable, collectable, destroyable and sellable, and there's a money system to justify your drilling efforts.
                The Emendation station currently only lets you buy items (such as explosives, teleporters, fuel/health), but should offer Hull repairs in the future. The explosives were actually already useable in the game since last week, however they did
                not have any sprites for the explosion, which looked really bad, so I chose not to mention them. They now have animations for exploding, and have been tweaked to feel better in addition to sorting out some explosive bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The previous level grid has been tweaked to support a surface based solution, which allows me to modify the visuals of the terrain by simply drawing (or subtracting) images on/from it. This was my way of tackling the constant visual terrain
                modification while drilling that was apparent in the original Motherload. Consulting a play-tester (my brother) revealed that this effect was vital to the charm of the original Motherload, and a huge part of what I wanted to capture. More visual effects
                are needed, and will hopefully come soon. Additionally, The World generation has been tweaked ever so slightly.
            </p>

                Maybe you've seen them already, but I ask you direct your attention toward the buttons in the menus. notice how they're outlined by a glow from the mouse. This effect was inspired by the awesome design in Windows 10's stock applications, such as
                the alarms & clock, calculator and calendar. I understand that this effect does not fit too well with the game I'm making, however the complete designs of the menus are completely inharminus and cluttered at the moment, so I figured experimenting
                with some technical ideas to relieve the pain of menu creation might be justifiable. You might've guessed that this effect was achieved with a shader, and, I wish you were right, but I shamefully admit that I am not good enough at shaders to make
                what would be a fairly simple shader to achieve this effect. I instead opted for surfaces (canvases). I'm basically drawing a glow image relative to the mouse, to a surface separate from the default one, then subtracting the alpha (reverse transparency)
                from everywhere other than around the text, then drawing the text on top of that.
            </p>

                I'm very happy with the progress I've made this week, although I suppose it is to be expected, considering
                how much time has been at my disposal. I've learnt to ignore the mental barrier of "I could've done better", or "someone else does twice what you do in a week, in a day". I've been reading (or rather listening to)
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021" class="link" target="_blank">a book</a> by Jordan Peterson that has helped me overcome these mental obstacles that hinder productive progress.

                The feature list now has a new color! Yellow - features that have been worked on significantly, but not completed nor scrapped. No new items have been added to the list, as I want to focus on completing most of these first.
