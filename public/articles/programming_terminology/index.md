# Programming Terminology

There's a bunch of terminology thrown around in programming, which can be very confusing for people who don't know everything about every programming topic. Thus I've created this list to explain a bunch of words, aberrations and concepts on a basic level. I've attempted to loosely sort them into categories, and explain things used to explain other things first.

# Syntax

- [Character]() (text)

- [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) is any text symbol that isn't visible. Space (" ") is the most common whitespace *character*, followed by new-line and tab. A text *character*, like (r), even with the same color as the background or fully transparent, is not considered a whitespace *character*.

- [Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) is the structure of a code, kinda like grammar of human languages. If you for example forget to write ``=`` between ``var something = something;``, that makes it invalid syntax. In most programming languages, *whitespace* either doesn't relate to syntax at all, or it matters very little. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is an example of a language where whitespace matters to syntax.

- [String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) is a list of text *characters*, that together might form a word, sentence or a whole book.

- [Object]()

- [Null]()

- [Undefined]()

- [Primitive Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type) are the different types of data that exists in a programming language. In Javascript, these are *strings*, numbers, *objects*, *null* and *undefined*.

- [Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) is a piece of stored information from one of the *primitive types*.

- [Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) is a combination of *values*, *operators*, *variables* and *functions*, that *evaluate* into a value.

# Rest

- [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) is a piece of software that offers a set of tools to help with development. IDEs always include a code editor, and often debuggers, consoles, image editors, resource lists, etc. An example of an IDE is [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), which provides a code editor, image editor, debugger, engine and more.
