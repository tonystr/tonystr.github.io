# Source Control in GMS2

Source Control is the modern equivalent of magic. You can perform necromancy, view parallel timelines, travel through time and so much more. The ironic part is that all of this isn't even particularly hard to get into and master. It's just as easy to integrate with an existing project as with a new one! Read along, and I promise you'll be a modern day sorcerer by the last paragraph.

## What is Source Control

Source control / Version control is a term for software that manages changes to data, here typically *source code*, but it also manages images, sound, and any other data that might be associated with your games. It keeps track of *what files* are added, removed or changed, *when* they were added/removed/changed, and *who* did it. If you accidentally delete a file, break a system, or your computer explodes, you can simply restore an earlier version with the click of a few buttons (you may also have to buy a new computer for that last one).

There are different SCMs (Source Control Managers), but the most common one is git -- at least in Gamemaker development and webdev. Despite the [slightly backwards terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#Common_terminology), git can be super easy to work with. Gamemaker actually has built-in source control support, although it's a bit slow, buggy and unintuitive. Luckily, there are plenty of alternatives. I personally prefer [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

Github Desktop is a *Git GUI*, which means "some application that runs git on your computer". [Github](https://github.com/) itself is a *source control host*, which means it's basically a massive server for storing your code on. A cloud if you will. You can host your code only on your computer, but a remote host is highly recommended. It's free, and means you can easily work on the same project on multiple computers, with multiple people, and rest assure your code is safe if your computer breaks or is reset.

## Setting up

Go [make yourself a user](https://github.com/join?source=tonystr.net) at github.com, and download the git GUI "[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)".
